- classic exercise and coding interview question
- This is great problem because it also reveals subject's knowlegde of some basic mathematics.
We are talking about high-school / college level maths. Knowledge that I admit we don't really need in every day life

Let's first take look at the problem

	Division was the most challenging basic operation in elementary school math classes. Learning division might have been easier if we had used FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz is a mathematical word game to teach children about division and divisibility. It is also a popular coding interview question. It is a brilliant programming problem to give job candidates because it reveals candidates' capabilities in basic programming and basic maths.

	<blockquote>
		Write a function that when given an integer (n) returns a string that is
		<ul>
			<li>"Fizz" if n is divisible by 3,</li>
			<li>"Buzz" if n is divisible by 5,</li>
			<li>"FizzBuzz" if n is divisible by both 3 and 5,</li>
			<li>The number itsel in all other cases.</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>

	The problem can be expanded by asking the candidate to write a program that, for example, prints all FizzBuzz results for inputs from 0 to 100.

	We all learned in elementary school that if a number is divisible by another, the remainder of the operation is zero. We can write an algorithm that checks if the remainder when the input (n) divided by 3 and 5 is zero. However, many solutions I've seen have not implemented the function efficiently, revealing a gap in the programmer's knowledge of mathematics. Here's a typical solution in JavaScript and Python.

	<pre class="jblog-code">
const fizzBuzz = (integer) => {
	if(typeof(integer) !== "number") throw new Error(`Invalid input type (must be an integer, got ${typeof(integer)})`);
	if(!Number.isInteger(integer)) throw new Error(`Invalid input value (must be an integer,got ${integer})`);
	if(integer % 3 === 0 && integer % 5 === 0) return "FizzBuzz";
	if(integer % 3 === 0) return "Fizz";
	if(integer % 5 === 0) return "Buzz";
	return integer.toString();
};
	</pre>
	<pre class="jblog-code">
def fizzBuzz(integer:int) -> str:
	if not isinstance(integer,int): raise TypeError(f"Invalid input type (must be an integer, got {type(integer)})")
	if integer % 3 == 0 and integer % 5 == 0: return "FizzBuzz"
	if integer % 3 == 0: return "Fizz"
	if integer % 5 == 0: return "Buzz"
	return str(integer)
	</pre>

	I've taken the liberty to use a more meaningful parameter name and to add validation for the argument type. While this solution is human-readable and quite literally matches the question, it is somewhat laborious for the computer. With a deeper understanding of divisibility, the solution can be optimized.
</p>

<p>
	If a number is divisible by both number a and number b, it is divisible by their product a×b. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, it is also divisible by their product 15. The inverse is also true. If a number n is divisible by number a, then n is also divisible by all factors of a. Factors are numbers that can be used to express another number as a product. 3 and 5 are factors of 15. Thus, the FizzBuzz divisibility check can be done with just one operation.

	<pre class="jblog-code">
if(integer % 15 === 0) return "FizzBuzz";
	</pre>
	<pre class="jblog-code">
if integer % 15 == 0: return "FizzBuzz"
	</pre>
</p>

<p>
	However, there are many ways to further improve and modify the solution. The initial solution still has some unnecessary clutter. In JavaScript and Python integer 0 is considered falsy and all other numbers are considered truthy. So equality operations can be replaced with simpler expressions.

	<pre class="jblog-code">
const fizzBuzz = (integer) => {
	if(typeof(integer) !== "number") throw new Error(`Invalid input type (must be an integer, got ${typeof(integer)})`);
	if(!Number.isInteger(integer)) throw new Error(`Invalid input value (must be an integer,got ${integer})`);
	if(!(integer % 15)) return "FizzBuzz";
	if(!(integer % 3)) return "Fizz";
	if(!(integer % 5)) return "Buzz";
	return integer.toString();
};
	</pre>
	<pre>
def fizzBuzz(integer:int) -> str:
	if not isinstance(integer,int): raise TypeError(f"Invalid input type (must be an integer, got {type(integer)})")
	if not integer % 15: return "FizzBuzz"
	if not integer % 3: return "Fizz"
	if not integer % 5: return "Buzz"
	return str(integer)
	</pre>
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, writing a nice one-liner algorithm can avoid the whole division by 15. For production purposes, we could separate the input validator from the algorithm. The algorithm could be used in repetitive and performance-critical tasks where input is reliable and the function in situations where the input is not reliable e.g. in a web application that takes user input.

	<pre class="jblog-code">
const fizzBuzzAlgorithm = (n) => (n%3 ? "" : "Fizz") + (n%5 ? "" : "Buzz") || n.toString();

const validateInteger = (input) => {
	if(typeof(input) !== "number") throw new Error(`Invalid input type (must be an integer, got ${typeof(input)})`);
	if(!Number.isInteger(input)) throw new Error(`Invalid input value (must be an integer,got ${input})`);
};

const fizzBuzzFunction = (integer) => {
	validateInteger(integer);
	return fizzBuzzAlgorithm(integer);
};

for(n=0; n&lt;=100; n++) console.log(fizzBuzzAlgorithm(n));
	</pre>
	<pre class="jblog-code">
fizzBuzzAlgorithm = lambda n : ("" if n%3 else "Fizz") + ("" if n%5 else "Buzz") or str(n)

def validateInteger(input) -> None:
	if not isinstance(input,int): raise TypeError(f"Invalid input type (must be an integer, got {type(input)})")

def fizzBuzzFunction(integer) -> None:
	validateInteger(integer)
	return fizzBuzzAlgorithm(integer)

for n in range(0,100):
	print(fizzBuzzAlgorithm(n))
	</pre>
